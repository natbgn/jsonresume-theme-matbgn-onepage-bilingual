A theme for JSONResume, that relies on Bootstrap and FontAwesome, added with some personal flair.

## Rendering overview

## Usage

To first get started with this JSONResume theme, you'll need to have the JSONResume CLI installed. If you haven't already install it with `npm install -g resume-cli`.

After this, you can get your resume.json ready by typing `resume init`. After hitting enter, your resume will be initialized and you can edit it and fill in the neccessary fields. Check out https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema[the official resume-schema repository] for more information on filling these fields.

When you are finished with your resume, you may test it by yet again opening the command line and typing `resume serve --theme kendall` to see how it looks with this theme. You can replace the word `kendall` with other theme names too.

### Install the command line

We're going to use the official https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli[resume-cli] to run our development server.

Go ahead and install it:

```
npm install -g resume-cli
```

### Install npm packages

We need to install the dependencies. `cd` into the theme folder we just downloaded and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will read the local `package.json` and install the packages listed under `dependencies`.

### Serve theme

While inside the theme folder, simply run:

```
node export.js ~/path/to/your/resume.json
```
e.g.
```
node export.js resume_demo.json
```

[NOTE]
====
You could also place your resume.json in the root folder of this project and run:

```
node export.js
```
====

You should now be able to render your html with a local server, for instance for VSCode:

```
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

TIP: **Right click on the newly generated `index.html`** Congratulations, you've made it!

__The theme development can now begin.__

### Print a PDF version

To print the resume in pdf in a 100% fidelity mode *use web browser OPERA*. Respectively it's built-in capture feature.

Before each print you can tweak the rendering by manipulating the rendered HTML code trough opera's code inspector.

## Multiple languages support

The categories are actually translated in:

* English (default)
* French

To switch languages, simply add the following lines at the bottom of your resume.json:

```
"meta": {
    "language": "fr"
}
```

## Block flexibility

The following blocks can either be printed on right or left side or relative to another:

* languages
* volonteer
* certifications

To switch sides, simply add the following lines at the bottom of your resume.json:

```
"meta": {
    "languagesSide": "left",
    "volonteerSide": "right",
    "certificationsBeforeEducation": "true"
}
```

## Tips

As of now, the theme supports the following profiles in the basics.profiles array.

* Facebook
* Github
* Twitter
* Google Plus
* YouTube
* Vimeo
* Linkedin
* Pinterest
* Flickr
* Behance
* Dribbble
* CodePen
* Soundcloud
* Steam
* Reddit
* Tumblr
* Stack Overflow
* Bitbucket
* Gitlab

Every single one of these is optional, and every field in the basics.profiles array **must** be entered without spaces. This theme will try to use the matching `-square` version of the icon from FontAwesome if it doesn't already have support for one of your profiles. If you want support for more social networks, feel free to leave an issue, or even better, submit a pull request. Thanks.

If you want to keep your resume mobile-friendly, please limit the number of profiles to 10, please. No one should have over 10 profiles on their resume anyway.

Every section is optional also. If per se, you do not include the publications array in your resume.json, no publications section will appear.

If you find any other problems with this theme in specified, do feel free to leave an issue. Thanks.
